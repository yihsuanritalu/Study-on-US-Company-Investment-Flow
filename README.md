This is the repository of a study into the investment flows of US non-financial companies after 2017 tax reform

Abstract: 
  
After the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) in the U.S., companies could repatriate offshore cash which had been inaccessible due to tax consideration. According to Fed's estimate, U.S. companies had accumulated approximately $1 trillion in cash abroad, held mostly in U.S. fixed-income securities. This study investigates the overall financial investment behavior of 391 non-financial companies in S&P 500 index in the first hlaf year of 2018 compared with previous period, with the total financial investment size at $1.5 trillion. The data comes from XBRL file released by the companies between May'18 and Sep'18 on SEC's website. This study utilized a combination of Python, for data extraction and data wrangling, and Tableau, for final presentation.
